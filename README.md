Game dev project for Fall 2020. More info to come


### Brief description of game:

**I**magine 2D Legend of Zelda meets Avatar the Last Airbender

• You have four warring regions and your role as the main character is to stop the war.

• You have the ability to reincarnate in between the regions - this mechanic is your means of traversal between the regions.

• In each of your incarnations you essentially play four different characters each with different abilities you can learn.

• The game is lore-focused and as you travel between the regions, you unlock areas you couldn't access before (your new region has taken over parts of the previous region).

• The game plays like a 2D Zelda game:  combat is real-time, you can talk to NPCs to get tidbits of information, there are hostile areas where you fight monsters, etc.
